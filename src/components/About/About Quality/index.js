          Although we work with growers who pay close attention to all stages of
          harvest and processing, we employ, on our end, a rigorous quality
          control program to avoid over-roasting or baking the coffee dry. Every
          bag of coffee is tagged with a roast date and batch number. Our goal
          is to roast consistent, user-friendly coffee, so that brewing is easy
          and enjoyable.
